# Inventory-Management-System-MERN


Hi,

This is the Inventory Management System App , I have build using MERN stack.

To start the application, open this repo in VS code. 

Open a termnal and then navigate to sever directory, give command 'npm install' to install all dependencies. Then give command 'node index.js' to start the server.

Then open a new terminal and navigate to client directory, give command 'npm install' to install all dependencies. Then give command 'npm start' to view the application 
in http://localhost:3000/ 

Thanks
